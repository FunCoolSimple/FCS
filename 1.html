    <h2>Fun</h2>
    <P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun" target="_blank" title="Fun meaning">Fun</a> is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "Light-hearted pleasure, enjoyment, or amusement; boisterous joviality or merrymaking; entertainment".[1] Although particularly associated with recreation and play, fun may be encountered during work, social functions, and in daily life. There are psychological and physiological implications to the experience of fun. Modern Westernized civilizations prioritize fun as an external and sexual aspect.[2]</P>
